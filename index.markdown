      Hi, I'm <span>Robert DeLuca</span>!
    </h3>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer who loves building awesome, accessible front-end experiences—web,
      native apps, or APIs, I've done it all. I've spent time delving deep into visual testing at Percy
      (now BrowserStack), where I created a plethora of content and supported developer communities. I
      even contributed to helping Visa Checkout achieve WCAG 2.0 compliance, ensuring accessibility for
      millions.

    <p>
      Tech always excites me—whether it’s tinkering with IoT gadgets, experimenting with Large
      Language Models, or building tools like my macOS app, DraftPatch.

      When I step away from the keyboard, you'll find me wrenching on my 1995 NA8 Spec Miata (#20)
      or racing it in the SCCA Spec Miata Southwest Division. Nothing beats the thrill of chasing
      the perfect lap! 🏎️🏁

      Let's connect and geek out sometime!
