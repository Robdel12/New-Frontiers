      Hi, I'm <span>Robert DeLuca</span>!
    </h3>
    <p>
      I love all things programming, from designing great user & developer
      experiences, to writing firmware for IoT devices. Over the past three
      years I have focused on building visual testing at <a href="https://percy.io">Percy</a>.
      I help maintain and build 15+ SDKs that integrate into various test
      frameworks and testing workflows. If you have a question about JavaScript,
      the JavaScript tool chain, browsers, browser automation, or testing, I can help!
    </p>

      When I'm not at a computer, I'm probably under a car or at the
      track. I'm currently competing in the SCCA Spec Miata South West
      Division driving a 1995 NA8 Spec Miata as #20.🏎 🏁
