      Hi, I'm <span>Robert DeLuca</span>!
    </h3>
    <p>
      With over 12 years of software engineering under my belt, I get a real kick out of shaping
      user experiences and streamlining developer workflows. You'll usually find me knee-deep in
      single-page applications, soaking up the challenges and fine-tuning every detail.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm all about web testing, too—it's like my secret sauce. Building sturdy test frameworks and
      ensuring apps run like a dream is my jam. Oh, and you might've heard of Percy.io? I had a
      blast there, handling customer chats and tinkering with SDKs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Off the clock, I'm a total tech junkie. Give me an IoT device, home automation gadgets, or talk
      cars, and I'm in my element. Let's geek out together sometime!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not at a computer, I'm probably under a car or at the track. I'm currently competing
      in the SCCA Spec Miata South West Division driving a 1995 NA8 Spec Miata as #20.🏎 🏁
