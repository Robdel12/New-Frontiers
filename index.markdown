      Hi, I'm <span>Robert DeLuca</span>!
    </h3>
    <p>
      With over a decade of experience in software engineering, I've developed a passion for
      crafting exceptional user experiences and streamlining developer workflows. You can usually find
      me diving into the details of single-page applications or experimenting with new technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not writing code, you might catch me geeking out over web testing ‚Äì it's my favorite
      way to ensure apps are rock-solid and performant. And yes, Percy.io was an amazing experience
      ‚Äì I loved working closely with customers to solve problems and pushing the limits of their
      SDKs.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my free time, I'm a total tech enthusiast. Give me an IoT gadget, a home automation
      project, or a car conversation, and I'm in my happy place! Let's grab coffee and geek out sometime!
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not behind a screen, you can find me tinkering under the hood of my 1995 NA8 Spec
      Miata (#20) or racing with the SCCA Spec Miata South West Division. It's an incredible
      adrenaline rush ‚Äì nothing beats the thrill of racing! üèé üèÅ
