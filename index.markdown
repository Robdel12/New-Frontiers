    <p>
      I love all things front-end, from designing great user
      experiences, ensuring they're accessible, crafting them in CSS, and
      powering them with JavaScript. I'm all about that OSS, that OSS, no
      closed source.

      I also love to collaborate with other developers! If you would
      like to pair on a problem you can reach me <a href="mailto:robertdeluca19@gmail.com">here</a>
