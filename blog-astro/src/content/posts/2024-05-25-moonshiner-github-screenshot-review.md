When you're working on user interface testing, reviewing screenshots as part of a pull request (PR)
can be a time-consuming and tedious process. However, by using a test runner like
[Moonshiner](https://github.com/wwilsman/moonshiner) to capture the screenshots and GitHub's
built-in rich diff feature for code changes, you can make this process more enjoyable and efficient.

Moonshiner is an open-source test runner that allows you to create tests that capture high-quality
screenshots of your UI. When you run these tests & commit the images, you get to see the
changes visually represented in the GitHub diff view. You can see the three different methods of
