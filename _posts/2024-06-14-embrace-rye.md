In the software development world, the principle of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is often heralded as
a golden rule. While DRY aims to reduce redundancy and improve code maintainability, it's not always
the best approach. In fact, adhering too strictly to DRY can lead to premature abstractions that
complicate your codebase unnecessarily. That's where RYE (Repeat Yourself Enough) comes in.

### Understanding RYE

RYE stands for Repeat Yourself Enough. The core idea behind RYE is to allow repetition in your code
until a clear, natural pattern emerges that justifies abstraction. This approach can prevent the
pitfalls of premature optimization and bad abstractions, ultimately leading to more readable and
maintainable code _(eventually)_.

### The Pitfalls of Premature Abstractions

Premature abstractions occur when developers abstract code too early, without fully understanding
the problem space. This can lead to convoluted and overly complex code that is hard to understand
and maintain. I can quickly think of some common issues with premature abstractions:

- **Overcomplication**: Abstractions can introduce unnecessary complexity, making it harder to
  follow the logic of the code.
- **Reduced Flexibility**: Early abstractions can limit your ability to adapt the code to new
  features.
- **Maintenance Headaches**: Bad abstractions can lead to tightly coupled code, making it harder to
  make changes or fix bugs.

### Why Repetition Isn’t Always Bad

Repetition in code is often viewed negatively, but it has its advantages:

- **Clarity**: Repeated code _can_ be clearer and easier to understand, as each piece of code does
  exactly what it says.
- **Simplicity**: By repeating code, you avoid the complexity that comes with premature
  abstractions.
- **Easier Refactoring**: When patterns do emerge, refactoring repeated code into a well-thought-out
  abstraction is simpler and more effective. It's also hella satisfying to ship that refactor.

### When to Abstract

Abstractions should be introduced only when there is a clear, recurring pattern that benefits from
being encapsulated. Here are some signs that it might be time to abstract:

- **Identifiable Pattern**: You've repeated the same or similar code enough times that a clear
  pattern has emerged.
- **Simplification**: Abstracting the repeated code simplifies the codebase without adding
  unnecessary complexity.
- **Maintainability**: The abstraction improves the maintainability of the code, making it easier to
  understand and modify.

### Embracing Copy/Paste

In the RYE approach, copying and pasting code is not a sin. Instead, it is a practical tool that
allows you to focus on solving the problem at hand without getting bogged down by unnecessary
abstractions. You shouldn’t fear the copy/paste method!

- **Rapid Development**: Copying and pasting code can speed up the development process, allowing you
  to iterate quickly.
- **Focused Problem Solving**: By repeating code, you can stay focused on the current problem
  without the distraction of creating abstractions.
- **Natural Abstractions**: Over time, as you repeat code, natural abstractions will become
  apparent, leading to better design decisions.

### With that said...

While DRY is a valuable principle, it's essential to balance it with the practicality of RYE. By
allowing yourself to repeat code until a clear pattern emerges, you can avoid the pitfalls of
premature abstractions and create a more maintainable codebase.

Remember, repetition isn’t the enemy -- bad abstractions are. So, don’t be afraid to repeat yourself
enough until you find the right time to abstract. Of course, don't run away with repetition and make
a mess, either! I think you get my point.
