That’s why we’re thrilled to release our new <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a> on the heels of the recent <a href="https://github.blog/2019-11-14-powering-community-led-innovation-with-github-actions/">general availability release</a>.</p><p>This powerful service by GitHub combines flexible automation and workflows with CI/CD functionality to automatically build, test, and deploy your projects. It works with any GitHub event, works on any platform, language, and cloud, and is largely community-led.</p><p><strong>Enabled by that flexibility and universality, we now support the ability to build and run Percy entirely from GitHub.</strong></p><h3>Getting started with Percy’s GitHub Actions</h3><p>Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">GitHub Actions Marketplace listings</a>, you’ll see Percy has three official actions that correspond to the Percy SDK you’re using.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OL0pze1MmMmWPa9gTIXhgw.png" /><figcaption><em>Shoutout to </em><a href="https://github.com/jpvalery"><em>@jpvalery</em></a><em> for making his own Percy action!</em></figcaption></figure><ul><li>If you’re using our Storybook SDK, you’ll want to use <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/percy-for-storybook">Percy for Storybook</a> (<a href="https://github.com/percy/storybook-action">storybook-action</a>).</li><li>If you’re using our CLI for static sites, you’ll want to use <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/percy-for-static-sites">Percy for Static Sites</a> (<a href="https://github.com/percy/snapshot-action">snapshot-action</a>).</li><li>For all SDKs that use the percy exec command, including our PercyScript, Cypress, and Puppeteer SDKs, use <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/percy">Percy</a> (<a href="https://github.com/percy/exec-action">exec-action</a>).</li></ul><p>Our GitHub Actions work in the same way as our existing <a href="https://docs.percy.io/docs/ci-setup">support for CI/CD services</a> to run your Percy tests when triggered by GitHub events such as pull requests.</p><h4>Configuring your environment variables</h4><p>To get started, you’ll need to configure PERCY_TOKEN, your project-specific, write-only API token. Copy the token from your project settings and add it to your GitHub repo secrets.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*56wnBFlq3nFgrWSo6Epe7w.png" /></figure><p>Once configured, your GitHub Action will pull your PERCY_TOKEN in from your secrets each time it runs to tell Percy where to send snapshots.</p><h4>Setting up a Percy GitHub Action</h4><p>Below, we’ll give an overview of getting started with exec-action, but they all work in generally the same way.</p><p>First, you’ll need to add a new step to your actions config using percy/exec-action. This acts as a wrapper around the percy exec command, so all you need to provide is the CLI command you use to launch your tests.</p><p>Here is a sample config that runs Cypress with Percy using the default setup:</p><pre>name: CI<br>on: [push, pull_request]<br>jobs:<br>  build:<br>    runs-on: ubuntu-latest<br>    steps:<br>      - name: Checkout<br>        uses: actions/checkout@v1.0.0<br>      - name: Install<br>        run: yarn<br>      - name: Percy Test<br>        uses: percy/exec-action@v0.1.2<br>        with:<br>          command: &quot;cypress run&quot;<br>        env:<br>          PERCY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERCY_TOKEN }}</pre><p>In the above example, cypress run is the command that our <a href="https://docs.percy.io/docs/cypress">Cypress SDK</a> uses to launch your tests. When that command gets called, Percy starts up an agent to receive snapshots from your Cypress tests and sends them to your configured Percy project.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*k8TXvmPFUhc2_G6Luo4YZQ.png" /></figure><p>GitHub Actions, paired with our existing <a href="https://docs.percy.io/docs/github">GitHub pull request integration</a>, makes it easier than ever to integrate visual testing, run Percy on each commit, and get alerted of visual changes—all in one place.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*wYzDp_W-eV32aydlgChyoQ.png" /></figure><p>To get started with Percy’s GitHub Actions, check out our <a href="https://docs.percy.io/docs/github-actions">GitHub Actions docs</a> to learn more and <a href="https://percy.io/signup">get started with a free Percy account</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7570c6a4757c" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://blog.percy.io/announcing-percys-github-actions-for-seamless-visual-testing-7570c6a4757c">Announcing Percy’s GitHub Actions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.percy.io">Percy Blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
